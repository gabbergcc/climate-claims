This article raises four points about how the reality of climate change is not consistent with the projections laid out in the IPCC reports. It discusses CO<sub>2</sub> levels, projected temperature rises, sea level rise, and extreme weather forecasts. 

Firstly, the article states that the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere (400 ppm) is negligible compared to other points in Earth’s history and that the IPCC scenarios for CO<sub>2</sub> levels rely on the supply of fossil fuels to continually increase (Climate Change Facts, 2020). However, fossil fuel production will peak at some point within the century which means it would be unrealistic for emissions to rise for the duration of it. According to NASA’s climate change webpage, the CO<sub>2</sub> levels currently are higher than any point during the past 400 000 years determined by analysing trapped air bubbles in ice cores (Shaftel, 2021). Humans were not alive millions of years ago when CO<sub>2</sub> levels were higher than they are now and the environmental conditions were quite different then. 

The article then goes on to suggest that the less than 1℃ increase of global temperatures may be because of a recovery from the preceding cold period (Climate Change Facts, 2020). The article questions whether this increase in temperature is attributable to humans and emphasizes that it is a trivial increase when considering Earth’s natural temperature variation. They state that the acceleration of temperature increase projected in the IPCC is highly unlikely and such a projection is likely due to issues in the data set, measurement calibration, urban heat islands being unaccounted for, and inappropriate design and placement of temperature stations. According to a 2019 paper by Neukon et al, there is no evidence for preindustrial globally coherent cold epochs using paleoclimate reconstructions from the past 2000 years (Neukom et al., 2019). This disproves that the global temperature increase is from a cold period recovery. 

Another claim is that studies have consistently shown no increase in sea level for the past 110 years (Climate Change Facts, 2020). The sources for this claim either have broken hyperlinks or lead to a non-peer reviewed source published 20 years ago. According to NASA’s satellite sea level measurements, the current rate of change of sea level is 3.3 mm per year and has increased almost 100 mm since 1993 (Shaftel, 2020). 

Finally, it is stated that extreme weather forecasts such as hurricanes, rainfall, and snow cover are not significantly different from natural variability in their occurrence (Climate Change Facts, 2020). According to the Yale School of Environment who cite a United Nations report, there has been an increase in the number of extreme weather events over the past two decades (Yale Environment, 2020). Additionally, this claim is not referenced in the original article. The final statement of the article is that an IPCC expert resigned due to misrepresentation of data by the IPCC which appears to be intended to further negate the IPCC reports. 

Overall, the argument being made is that there are issues with the IPCC projections being overly aggressive and not substantiated by what is actually being observed. Additionally, it is interesting to see that there are quite a few sources who do not agree with the IPCC reports. Science is a process which relies heavily on observation. Through time, more reliable methods of predicting or modelling what we might observe in the future given a set of present observations have developed. However, there is still error that can occur in even the most robust models. This article suggests that reality not matching the models exactly invalidates them entirely. Such a sentiment is precarious because it ignores that models inherently have a margin of error which is oftentimes fully recognized in the literature. 

This article is not very credible. To begin, it is not well referenced as many links embedded in the text are broken and there is not a bibliography at the end of the webpage. As outlined in the website’s ‘About Us’ page, it is intended to present objective information to those who want information on all sides of the story of climate change and the opinion of a systems analyst, Dr. John T. Everett (Everett, 2020). Everett has a PhD in business administration and has worked for a variety of environmental organizations including the IPCC. Given that the ‘About Us’ page suggests those who have already determined climate change to be real go elsewhere to not be confused by facts, the article does not uphold its claim of objectivity (Everett, 2020). Finally, many of the claims in the article are incorrect and misinterpretation of data.
